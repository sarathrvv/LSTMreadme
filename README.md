# Stock price prediction using ML
# # Introductio
The project&#39;s purpose is to forecast future price fluctuations for a certain stock. Prices from
previous days, as well as financial news articles relevant to the company of interest, are used to
produce these predictions. Given insufficient information, price swings arising from a mixed
reaction of general market attitude, the company&#39;s financial news, the company&#39;s and the
industry&#39;s future prospects, and occasionally murmurs concerning the company&#39;s previous
performance are difficult to rationalize correctly. In order to predict future stock prices using
past prices and news headlines, a number of supervised learning algorithms were investigated.
This concept is based on the observation that stock prices frequently rebound after huge losses
or self-correct after successive increases, and that unexpected news or analyst remarks
frequently have a significant impact on stock prices.
